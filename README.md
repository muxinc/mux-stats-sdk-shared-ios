# MUXSDKStatsShared

Mux iOS shared components including models, services and utilities to be used within the player sdks integrations built on top of Mux Core. 

## Installation

MUXSDKStatsShared is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'MUXSDKStatsShared'
```

Once you pull the latest version of this sdk, the files from the pod should be added to the compile sources of the player sdk to be compiled as a part of it, with the intention of reducing any overhead for the final user of the frameworks.
